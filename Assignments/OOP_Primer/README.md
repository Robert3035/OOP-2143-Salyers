## Definitions

####  Abstract Classes and Interfaces

> An abstract class is a class that cannot be directly instantiated and serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from.

#### Abstraction

>Abstraction is the programming process of creating a data type, usually a class, that hides the details of the data representation.

#### Access Modifiers (Public, Private, Protected)

>Access modifiers are a way to hide certain data from other parts of a program or from leaving that program.

#### Attributes / Properties

>Attributes are properties or characteristics that you can assign to different elements, like variables, objects, or classes. They provide additional information or behavior to these elements, helping you define their specific traits.

#### Class Variable

>A class variable is a variable that belongs to and exists within the scope of a class or object.

#### Classes and Objects

>Classes are data types created as a template to be reused and created in instances called objects

#### Collections and Iterators

>An iterator is an object that progressively provides access to each item of a collection, in order.

#### Composition

>The design technique to implement has-a relationship between objects.

#### Constructors and Destructors

>Constructors and Desctructors are default member functions used to create and destroy an object or instance of a class

#### Design Patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer)

>Design patterns are solutions to common project problems that are based on experience, best practices, and many trials and errors.

#### Encapsulation

>Encapsulation refers to the practice of bundling data with the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, typically within a class.

#### Exception Handling

>A programming concept that manages unexpected events or errors that occur while a program is running.

#### File I/O in OOP

>File I/O refers to the process of reading data from or writing data to a file on a computer's storage system.

#### Friends

>Friends are objects that are able to access each others private member variables or functions

#### Generics and Templates

>Generics and template referto a programming technique where you can write code that works with different data types by defining placeholder types

#### Inheritance

>Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class.

#### Instance Variable

>An instance variable is a variable that is created when a class is defined and holds unique values for each instance of the class.

#### Member Variable

>A member variable is a variable that is associated with an object and can be accessed by all of its methods.

#### Memory Management (Garbage Collection, Pointers)

>GC uses pointers to identify objects that are still in use, and reclaims memory for objects that are no longer referenced.

#### Method Overloading

>Method overloading is a programming technique that allows multiple methods to have the same name but different implementations.

#### Method

>A method is a block of code that contains a series of statements that are executed when called by a program.

#### Multiple Inheritance

>Multiple inheritance is a feature that allows a subclass to inherit from more than one superclass.

#### Multithreading in OOP (time permitting)

> Multithreading is the ability of a program or an operating system to enable more than one user at a time without requiring multiple copies of the program running on the computer.

#### Object Relationships (Association, Aggregation, Composition)

>Composition is defined by the PART-OF relationship which means that one object IS PART-OF ANOTHER OBJECT, but Aggregation is defined by the HAS-A relationship which means that one object HAS-A RELATION with another object.

#### Object-Oriented Design Principles

>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of "objects" to simplify the software development process. OOP promotes code reusability, modularity, and extensibility.

#### Operator Overloading

>Operator overloading allows programmers to customize how operators work with user-defined classes.

#### Overloading

>Overloading is the ability to create multiple functions of the same name with different implementations.

#### Polymorphism

>Polymorphism allows objects to have multiple forms and take on different types.

#### Public / Private / Protected

>Access modifiers where "public" allows access from anywhere, "protected" allows access within the class and its inherited classes, and "private" only allows access within the defining class itself.

#### SOLID Principles

#### Static (Methods and Variables)

>A static variable or method belongs to the class itself, not to any individual object created from that class.

#### Testing in OOP (Unit Testing, Test-Driven Development)

>Testing is the practice of writing automated tests to verify that individual units of code (like methods within a class) function correctly.

#### UML Diagrams and Modeling

>A Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram provides a visual representation of an aspect of a system.

#### Virtual

>A virtual function or method is a function or method that can be overridden and inherited.
